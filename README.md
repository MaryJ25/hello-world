# hello-world

Hello to the poor souls who took on reading this nonsense.
I am Mary. I avoid writing my esseys for university without feeling very guilty about it by learning how to code. Coding is fun, but I'm studying psychology so this doesn't make much sense. Things rarely make sense in my world. I know some HTML and CSS, currently working on JavaScript and later I will be learning Node.JS. I haven't made much with what I learned, only a small page about The Trinity of Nothing, it's for worshipers of cucumbers, fish and trees, it has pretty pictures.
I will stop now.
